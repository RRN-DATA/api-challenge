ANALYSIS FROM LINEAR REGRESSION PLOTS
1. In the Northern Hemisphere, Maximum temperature in the cities is increasing as we go near to the Equator
2. In the Southern Hemisphere, the temperatures do not show a sharp trend like in northern hemisphere, a trend of increase in temperatures as we go near to the equator is observed

3. In the northern hemisphere, Humidity in the cities increases as we go away from the equator
4. In contrast, humidity in the Southern cities increases as we go near equator and almost remain constant in cities located at -30S 

5. Cloudiness increases drastically in the cities located between 30-50 degrees North
6. Cloudiness increases drastically in the cities located between -15 to -25 degrees South

7. Wind Speed increases drastically in the cities located between 35-55 degrees North
8. Wind Speed increases drastically as we go toward the South pole
